Hi, I’m Jonas Geiselhart, born in 2001 and currently living in Weil der Stadt, near Stuttgart.

My main focus is on self-supervised and unsupervised deep learning, especially in computer vision and spatial scene understanding. I’m passionate about exploring how machines interpret the world and how we can build smarter systems
