Initally I made this pages account using a fork from [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted it on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). It was there to show some of the work I did in university starting with my bachelors degree in Computer Science and my masters degree in Artifical Intelligence and Data Science, but i do not restrict myself to those topics in my posts.
