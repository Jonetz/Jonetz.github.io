# Jonas Geiselhart
Hi, I’m Jonas Geiselhart, born in 2001 and currently living in Weil der Stadt, near Stuttgart. I began my journey in computer science in 2019, studying Informatik at the University of Stuttgart, where I completed my Bachelor’s degree in 2022. I continued my studies with a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, also in Stuttgart.

My passion lies in self-supervised and unsupervised deep learning, particularly within the realms of computer vision and spatial/scene understanding tasks. I love diving deep into how machines can perceive and interpret the world around them, and I’m always excited about building smarter systems to achieve that.

I’m also deeply fascinated by the idea of improving our computational models by learning from how our brain processes information. While this is a small note in my research interests, understanding the parallels between biological and artificial intelligence could be key to advancing the future of AI.

# Outside of Tech
When I’m not coding or exploring the latest in AI, I dedicate a lot of my time to community and volunteer work. I’m actively involved in:

Volunteer Firefighter and Youth Leader for Fire Department
Students’ Representatives for Computer Science at the University of Stuttgart
Student Representatives Union (stuvus) in Stuttgart
To stay active, I enjoy cycling and skiing, which helps me keep both my body and mind fit.

If you’d like to get in touch, feel free to reach out via email at jonasgeiselhart@aol.com (yes, AOL still exists!). I typically reply within 2 days to one week.
