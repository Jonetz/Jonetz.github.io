Hi, I’m Jonas Geiselhart, born in 2001 and currently living in Weil der Stadt, near Stuttgart. I began my journey in computer science in 2019, studying Informatik at the University of Stuttgart, where I completed my Bachelor’s degree in 2022. I continued my studies with a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, also in Stuttgart.

My main focus is on self-supervised and unsupervised deep learning, especially in computer vision and spatial scene understanding. I’m passionate about exploring how machines interpret the world and how we can build smarter systems
Also i amintrigued by how insights from brain processing could help improve our computational models.

## Outside of Tech
When I’m not coding or exploring the latest in AI, I dedicate a lot of my time to community and volunteer work. I’m actively involved in:

Volunteer Firefighter and Youth Leader for Fire Department
Students’ Representatives for Computer Science (FIUS) at the University of Stuttgart
Student Representatives Union (stuvus) in Stuttgart
To stay active, I enjoy cycling and skiing, which helps me keep both my body and mind fit.
