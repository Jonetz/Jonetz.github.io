Hi, I’m Jonas Geiselhart, a Software Engineer for Artificial Intelligence, living in Baden-Württemberg.  

This blog is a space where I share my projects, ideas, and reflections—both professional and personal. While much of my work involves machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning, I also like exploring the broader context of technology, everyday life, and personal experiences. Each project I post about usually has a unique angle, a lesson learned, or an aspect I found particularly interesting.  

I try to make every topic approachable: I aim to explain concepts clearly so that even those new to the field can follow along, while also diving deeper into selected aspects for readers who want more insight.  

Feel free to reach out:
