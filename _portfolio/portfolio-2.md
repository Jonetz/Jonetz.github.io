Here we implemented a part of the Ordinos Voting System proposed by KÃ¼sters et al. ([link](https://publ.sec.uni-stuttgart.de/kuestersliedtkemuellerrauschvogt-eurosp-2020.pdf)).
We mainly implemented the ideas already proposed in another [bachelor-thesis](http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-10699), and optimized the procedures.
