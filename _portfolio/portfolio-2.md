Here we implemented a part of the Ordinos Voting System proposed by KÃ¼sters et al. ([link](https://publ.sec.uni-stuttgart.de/kuestersliedtkemuellerrauschvogt-eurosp-2020.pdf)).
We mainly implemented the ideas already proposed in another [bachelor-thesis](http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-10699), and optimized the procedures.

We also mae an academic essay to describe what we did in form of looking at the Zero Knowledge Proof, the Voting Systems and how to implement this in a Offline phase ([here](http://jonetz.github.io/files/Forschungsprojekt.pdf))
