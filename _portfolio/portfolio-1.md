For this seminar i decided to look at the security aspects of adversarial classification. This includes a presentation, as well as short academic essay. Be aware that both are only descriptive of other peoples work and i did not include any of my own ideas or theses in there. 

You can find the slides that correspond to the 30 minute presentation [here](http://jonetz.github.io/files/Seminar_Folien.pdf) and the academic essay [here](http://jonetz.github.io/files/Seminar_Infsec_Ausarbeitung.pdf), both of them are written in german.
