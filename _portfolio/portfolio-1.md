In this portfolio entry, I share my seminar experience where I focused on exploring the security aspects of adversarial classification. The seminar included a 30-minute presentation and an accompanying academic essay. Please note that both the presentation and the essay purely describe the work of others without incorporating any personal ideas or theses.

You can access the slides for the 30-minute presentation [here](http://jonetz.github.io/files/Seminar_Folien.pdf). These slides provide an overview of the seminar, discussing key concepts and findings related to adversarial classification.

For the academic essay, written in German, you can find it [here](http://jonetz.github.io/files/Seminar_Infsec_Ausarbeitung.pdf). The essay offers a detailed analysis of adversarial classification within the realm of information security.

By exploring these resources, you can gain insights into my seminar presentation and academic exploration of the security aspects of adversarial classification.
